## About the site

My wife and I discovered Boquete, Chiriqui Panama at the end of a seven year quest to move from the United States to a place less driven by marketing, advertising and the stress of acquisition. Without this becoming a text on economics allow me to say the quality of life we have discovered in Panama exceeds our expectations.

We stumbled across Boquete while touring Panama. Boquete was a side trip on our path to La Amistad International Peace Park; we never made it to the park. We found Boquete in July 2006, sold our house and moved here in August 2006. An amazing transition in a very short time.

My wife left Boquete, it was not for her. I stayed and have created a new life. A life I am enjoying far more than my past.

Since I have been here, I have created a blog of my expereinces that has become very popular, a rather unintended consequence. http://www.boqueteguide.com it is frequently linked from the main articles in this newsletter.

For about a year I wrote a news letter for Live and Invest Overseas called the Panama Letter. It allowed me an opportunity to travel from point to point in this diverse country and share my experiences.

I have now twice been elected by my neighbors to the lowest possible elected position in Panama. I am a Voice on the local water board. With this lofty position I have learned too much about water and bureaucracy in Panama. When you are an expat you think every hurdle is special and for you. When you are a official of an elected body you discover the problems are universal.

In 2007 I created http://www.boquetening.com a community forum to allow people to learn about the community.   It now seems to have a life of it’s own and is highly recommended to potential tourists and people considering relocation. The site allows you to research years of experiences posted by others and ask questions of your own.

I did about a year of service as treasurer of Fundacion Alto Al Crimen an organization that provides a local equivalent of 911 and a bit more to the community.  Now I have taken over responsibility for the Tuesday Community Meetings at the Boquete Community Players Community Center.

Recently, stimulated by requests I have started to sell Boquete Coffee online for delivery to the US and Canada. There is a website for that BoquetePanamaCoffee.com

My life is full, but now with things I choose rather than those chosen for me.



As time allows I blog my experiences for all who care to read about them, for visitors and other residents. If you want to participate this is an open blog, you can comment, you can signup, you can post.
