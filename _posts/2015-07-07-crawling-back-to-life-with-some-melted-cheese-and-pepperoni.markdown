I am moving slowly but that seems like a good time to bring back an old feature, polls. Today on Facebook some one wrote an objective negative review of a Pizza Spot in Boquete. I offered to do a poll, well I did. The polls are back on Boquete guide in the right column. Please make your opinion, subjective as it is,  heard. You can vote for two places so things are easy.

If nothing else this will let tourists know the most ubiquitous, typical Panamanian food to be found in Boquete is probably pizza.

I like this food poll idea, it means nothing at all because anyone can vote, although in this case only twice. Food taste is totally subjective.  Trip Advisor has demonstrated to me on several voyages that sometimes the mob rules, other times the deck was stacked. Still when lot of people say La Posada has good Pizza and few believe my shill about pizza Gyros you can tell there is a least a guide for tourists who do not necessarily want to try every dough throwing place in town.

I will add about one food poll a week since I quit reviewing restaurants several years ago and let those who care to venture opinions offer there views. Of course I will throw a pie in, once in a while.
